# Smoke Counter

**Smoke Counter** is a simple and helpful web application that calculates how much money a user spends on cigarettes over different time periods (per day, week, month, half-year, and year). Itâ€™s designed to raise awareness about the financial cost of smoking and help users make more informed decisions.
